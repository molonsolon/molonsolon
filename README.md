Hello! I’m @molonsolon.


I’m interested in web app and front-end development as well as merging my other artistic mediums with programming. 

I’m currently teaching myself front-end web development using HTML, CSS, Javascript and React 
through The Odin Project and other assorted online informational resources.

I’m looking to collaborate on creative web appllications and sites that incorporate new methods of sharing art online.

Email me @m010ns010n@protonmail.com or DM me on Twitter @MolonSolon. 


Thanks for stopping by <3
